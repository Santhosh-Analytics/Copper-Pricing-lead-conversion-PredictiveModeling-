## Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models to address the challenges faced by the copper industry in pricing and lead classification. By leveraging advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, the project delivers robust solutions for accurate pricing decisions and effective lead classification.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the following objectives:

1. Explore skewness and outliers in the copper industry dataset.
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
3. Build a machine learning regression model to predict the continuous variable 'Selling_Price'.
4. Develop a machine learning classification model to predict lead status (WON or LOST).
5. Create a Streamlit application where users can input column values and obtain predicted 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' (WON/LOST).

## Data Source

The copper industry dataset used in this project should be provided or specified.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/copper-modeling.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd copper-modeling
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Prepare the data:

Obtain the copper industry dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.


## Run the data preprocessing scripts:

Execute the scripts to handle missing values, treat outliers, and address skewness in the dataset.
Perform feature engineering and encoding as required.


## Train the models:

Run the scripts to train the regression model for predicting 'Selling_Price'.
Train the classification model for predicting lead status (WON or LOST).


## Launch the Streamlit application:

Execute the Streamlit script to start the interactive application.
Input the required column values and obtain predictions for 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' (WON/LOST).



## Models
The project includes the following machine learning models:

Regression model: [Model name(s)] for predicting the continuous variable 'Selling_Price'.
Classification model: [Model name(s)] for predicting lead status (WON or LOST).

## Streamlit GUI
The project includes a user-friendly Streamlit application that allows users to input column values and obtain predictions for 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' (WON/LOST) based on the trained models.
