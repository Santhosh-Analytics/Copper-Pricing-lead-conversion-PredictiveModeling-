## Overview

This project aims to develop machine learning models to address the challenges faced by the copper industry in pricing and lead classification. By leveraging advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, the project delivers robust solutions for accurate pricing decisions and effective lead classification.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the following objectives:

1. Explore skewness and outliers in the copper industry dataset.
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
3. Build a machine learning regression model to predict the continuous variable 'Selling_Price'.
4. Develop a machine learning classification model to predict lead status (WON or LOST).
5. Create a Streamlit application where users can input column values and obtain predicted 'Selling_Price' or 'Status' (WON/LOST).

## Data Source

The copper industry dataset used in this project should be provided or specified.
